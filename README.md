## Problem

You will have a local list of movies that should be displayed in any order. The list is ​searchable and the search results will be categorized by Year.

Each search result category will hold at most the ​top rated 5 movies​ of this category (year​)​.
Once a movie is selected from the search results, you will switch to a detailed view to unveil the following:
- Movie Title
- Movie Year
- Movie Genres (if any)
- Movie Cast (if any)
- A two column list of pictures fetched from flickr that matches the movie title as the search
query
